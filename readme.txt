This is an implementation of Time Curves for visualizing wikipedia revision histories as presented in:

B. Bach, C. Shi, N. Heulot, T. Madhyastha, T. Grabowski, and P. Dragicevic, “Time curves: Folding time to visualize patterns of temporal evolution in data,” IEEE Trans. Vis. Comput. Graph., vol. 22, no. 1, pp. 559–568, 2016.
